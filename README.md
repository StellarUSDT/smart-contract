# Stellar.USDT

**Stellar.USDT** is a BEP-20 smart contract designed for creating and managing a stablecoin similar to USDT on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The project focuses on fast transactions, minimal fees, and flexible supply management through minting and burning.

# Project Overview

**Stellar.USDT** provides a solution for creating stablecoins on the Binance Smart Chain. The project is designed to ensure:
- High transaction performance with minimal fees.
- Flexible management of token supply through minting and burning mechanisms.
- Seamless integration with popular wallets and decentralized applications (dApps).

---

# Key Features

- **BEP-20 Standard:** Full compatibility with the existing Binance Smart Chain infrastructure.
- **High Performance:** Fast transactions at minimal gas costs.
- **Flexible Supply Management:** Ability to mint new tokens and burn existing ones to regulate total supply.
- **Access Control Model:** Implementation of role-based permissions (owner, minter, burner, and optionally a pauser) for secure contract management.
- **Optional Features:** Implementation of transfer fees, fee distribution for project development, automated liquidity, or deflationary mechanisms; pause functionality for emergency situations.

# Token Mechanics

# Access Control Model

The contract implements role-based access control to allow:
- **Owner:** Full control over the contract settings, including transferring ownership.
- **Minter:** Permission to mint new tokens.
- **Burner:** Permission to burn tokens, reducing the total supply.
- **Pauser (Optional):** Ability to pause token transfers in case of emergencies or vulnerabilities.

This implementation can be based on [OpenZeppelin Access Control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control).

# Mint and Burn Functions

- **Mint (Token Issuance):**  
  This function creates new tokens and assigns them to a specified address. For example:
  ```solidity
  function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyMinter {
      _mint(to, amount);
  }
Burn (Token Destruction):
This function reduces the total supply by destroying tokens from a specified address. For example:
 
function burn(address from, uint256 amount) external onlyBurner {
    _burn(from, amount);
}
Fees and Distribution (Optional)
If your smart contract implements transfer fees, the logic may include:

A fixed percentage fee deducted from each transaction.
Distribution of the collected fee among holders, a development fund, automated liquidity provisioning, or burning (deflationary model).
Pause Function (Optional)
The pause function allows temporarily halting transactions. This can be useful in case vulnerabilities or critical issues are discovered. When the contract is paused, most token operations are blocked until the pause is lifted.

Technology Stack
Solidity 0.8.25: Programming language used for the smart contract.
OpenZeppelin Contracts: Standardized contracts for BEP-20/ERC-20 implementation, access control, and security.
Hardhat / Truffle: Frameworks for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
Binance Smart Chain: Mainnet or testnet for deploying the project.
Node.js and npm/yarn: For dependency management and running scripts.
Installation and Setup
Clone the Repository:

 
git clone https://github.com/StellarUSDT/smart-contract.git
cd smart-contract
Install Dependencies:

 
npm install
 

 
yarn install
Configure Environment: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables (replace with your actual values):

 
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
BSC_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
BSCSCAN_API_KEY=your_bscscan_api_key
Update Configuration:
Configure hardhat.config.js or truffle-config.js to use the variables from the .env file.

Building and Testing
Compile the Contract:
 
npx hardhat compile
Run Tests:
 
npx hardhat test
Make sure to test key scenarios:
Minting and burning tokens.
Transfers between addresses.
Access control checks.
(Optional) Fee functionality and pause mode.
Deployment
Prepare the Network:
Ensure your deployment account has sufficient BNB to cover gas fees.

Run the Deployment Script (Example for Hardhat):

 
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bsc
Save the Contract Address:
After deployment, record the contract address for future reference and verification.

Contract Verification on BscScan
Obtain an API key from BscScan.
Ensure the API key is added to your .env file (variable: BSCSCAN_API_KEY).
Execute the verification command (example for Hardhat):
 
npx hardhat verify --network bsc <contract_address> [constructor_arguments]
Verify that the contract appears as verified on BscScan.
Security
Smart Contract Audit:
It is recommended to have the contract audited by independent security experts before public deployment.

Access Control:
Separate permissions among different addresses (Owner, Minter, Burner, Pauser) to minimize risks.

Protect Private Keys:
Never store private keys or sensitive data in public repositories.

Pause Functionality:
Implement and test the pause mode for emergency situations.

Regular Updates:
Monitor updates for dependencies (e.g., OpenZeppelin Contracts) and promptly address any security vulnerabilities.
